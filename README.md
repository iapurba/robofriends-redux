In order to run this project follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

This web app is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).
It implements a simple user interface which shows 500 random robots, and user can search for them using the above search box. Very cool.
Most importanly this app use APIs to render it's contents.
All the robots images are rendered by calling [robohash api](https://robohash.org)
and all that dummy names and emails are rendered by calling [jsonplaceholder api](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments).

This app is also an example of PWA (progressive webapp) which behaves like native apps with splash screen.
